**Anaxi** *(named after the ancient Greek philosopher and cartographer Anaximander)* is a civilisation simulator made in Ebitengine, with the main goal of making a visually appealing and interactive timeline of the world using cellular automata.

*Currently the "game" only features a basic migration simulation on a map (defmap.png) where you can see the population of any cell with your mouse cursor and control the speed. Clicking gives some debugging info in the terminal.*

Can be built with `go build`. If you're not on Windows follow the [Ebitengine installation guide](https://ebitengine.org/en/documents/install.html?os=linux).

Planned features:
- ~~Underlying world map~~
- Tribes and countries
- Wars and diplomacy
- Speed/pause controls
- GPU acceleration with OpenCL (scary!)
- Interactivity
- Stats and graphs!
- Custom maps (and random maps?)
